## Explanation of IOT and software development Department task:
### - User interface analysis, design, and implementation for robot control system using JQUERY and web development technique.

For my task, I started with frontend approaches. The user interface should fetch and send data, present data to the user, and allow user interaction. and for any logic that is related to database communication, I will be handled on the backend.

For frontend programming I used. HTML as the base skeleton and CSS for the styling. For the backend, I need a programming language that runs on a server, so I chose PHP.
